### Basic Solidity Project - Boilerplate ^0.4.17

> Local development with ganache-cli

Project includes:
1. solc
2. truffle
3. ganache
4. mocha
5. web3

You have example files to take a look at:
`
contracts/ContractName.sol
`
<br>
And you have example for compiling script
`
ContractName.compile.js
`
<br>
You need to change all names and information for your specific project

#### Notice
I chosed to work with every contract as single project with private deployment / compile scripts, if you want, you can do it all together.
